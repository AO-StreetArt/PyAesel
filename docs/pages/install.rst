Installing PyAesel
==================

Building from Source
--------------------

PyAesel requires Python and pip installed, and all other dependencies can be
installed from the root project directory with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --user -r requirements.txt

If desired, you can run the tests (require a running Aesel server on localhost):

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pytest

Finally, drop the library anywhere on your Python Path to start using it!
